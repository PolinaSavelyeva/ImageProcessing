## What is ImageProcessing?

ImageProcessing is an easy-to-use F# package that utilizes [Brahma.FSharp](https://github.com/YaccConstructor/Brahma.FSharp)
and [SixLabors.ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp). It offers two primary image processing options: CPU
and GPU or agent-supported processing, all accessible within the included console application.

## Why use ImageProcessing?

* Loading images from a local source and saving them.
* Processing all images within a specified directory.
* Filtering using one of five kernels, including "Gaussian blur" and "edges".
* Other edits such as 90-degree rotation and flipping.
* Combinations of existing transformations in four different scenarios.
* Ability to utilize all of the features solely through the command line.
